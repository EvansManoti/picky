# HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

## CLOCKYVET
The system enables you to input your time in a 12-hour clock system and return the output in a 24-hour clock system regardless if it is am or pm.

## TWOPY
This one enables you to get the output of your data if you enter two positive numbers and one negative you get a return statement that is 'true'
if you input three positive numbers you receive a false statement if you have one positive number one negative and a zero you get a statement that is a 'false' and for three negative numbers you get a 'false'
